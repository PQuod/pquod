### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm P_Quod, a french artist based in Rennes, occasionaly developing websites either showcasing different artistic activities or just exploring code.

I love HTML and CSS of course but I'm also into SQL databases, some PHP and trying to develop my skills in js. I'm currently exploring the infinite possibilities of static websites.

My personal website is just [here](http://luciedesaubliaux.fr)

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning js
